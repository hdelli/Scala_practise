There are pillars near the road. The distance between the pillars is
the same and the width of the pillars is the same. Your function accepts three arguments:

  number of pillars (â‰¥ 1);
  distance between pillars (10 - 30 meters);
  width of the pillar (10 - 50 centimeters).
  Calculate the distance between the first and the last pillar in centimeters
  (without the width of the first and last pillar but including the pillars inbetween).
